## üìã Requirements

### üß∞ System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Network**: Access to a Reticulum network (radio interfaces, internet gateways, or local testnet)

### üêç Python Dependencies (included in requirements.txt)

- `reticulum` >= rns 1.0.0 - Reticulum networking protocol stack for connection and NomadNetwork retrival
- `flask` >= 2.0.0 - Base Web framework for the browser UI interface
- `waitress` >=2.1.2 - Web Server Framework


-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### ‚ö° PREREQUISITES:

**Configure Reticulum:**
   
- Before launching the script or the Docker image, you need a full configured and working instance of Reticulum, 
- At least one TCPClientInterface in your ./reticulum/config file to access NomadNetwork 

NOTE: You don't need to run RNS manually, just make sure your instance is working and can connect to Reticulum Network!


## üíª Install Option 1: Run from terminal

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fr33n0w/rBrowser.git
   cd rBrowser
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start rBrowser:**
   ```bash
   python3 rBrowser.py [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
   ```

4. **Open your web browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:PORT
   ```
   (Default port is 5000, default host is 0.0.0.0 if not specified)

5. **Wait for node discovery:**

   - The browser will start listening for NomadNetwork announces
   - Discovered nodes will appear in the left sidebar
   - Click on any node to browse its content and navigate pages
   - or manually paste address in the bar without waiting for announces
   - Check bottom-left Status Bar for connection status info 


---

## üê≥ Install Option 2: Docker & Docker Compose

- This repository includes a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yaml so you can run rBrowser in a container. 
- The compose setup builds the image and exposes the web UI on port 5000.

### Prerequisites

#### Install Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
# Check if already installed

docker --version
docker-compose --version

# If not installed on Debian/Ubuntu

# Install Docker

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io

# Install Docker Compose (standalone)

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

```

### Quick Start (with Docker installed)

```bash
# Configure Docker User Permissions

# Add current user to docker group (if not already present)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# IMPORTANT: Log out and log back in for the group change to take effect

# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/fr33n0w/rBrowser

# Enter root repo directory
cd rBrowser

# Build and start in background
docker compose up -d

# Follow logs
docker compose logs -f rbrowser


# Useful Commands

# Rebuild image and restart
docker compose build --no-cache rbrowser
docker compose up -d

# Stop the container
docker compose down

# View running containers
docker ps

```

Notes:
- The Dockerfile copies a repository `config` file into the container at /home/appuser/.reticulum/config. Ensure you have a valid Reticulum config file named `config` in the repo root before building, or mount your config at runtime:
  - Example volume override in docker-compose.yaml:
    volumes:
      - ./config:/home/appuser/.reticulum/config:ro
- Use `docker compose ps` to check service and healthcheck status (compose file includes a basic HTTP healthcheck).
- Stop and remove containers with `docker compose down`

## At the end, open the rBrowser UI at: http://localhost:5000 (or your configured port)

## üì± Install Option 3: Termux on Android

You can run rBrowser directly on Android by using [Termux](https://termux.dev/), which gives you a full Linux environment. This keeps the Python code unchanged but lets you browse the UI from the same handset.

1. **Install Termux**
   - Install the latest Termux build from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) (Play Store builds are outdated).
   - Open Termux once so it completes its storage setup.

2. **Prepare the environment**
   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   pkg install python git clang rust binutils make cmake pkg-config libffi openssl libsodium

   # Optional but recommended
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
   - The `cryptography` dependency (pulled in by Reticulum) builds from source on Android, so Rust, clang, and common build tools must be installed.
   - Reticulum uses cryptography and libsodium; Termux packages provide the required native libraries.
   - If you plan to keep the session alive while the screen is off, run `termux-wake-lock`.

3. **Clone and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fr33n0w/rBrowser.git
   cd rBrowser
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - If pip still exits with `Rust not found` or `Unsupported platform` errors, verify `rustc --version` runs inside Termux and rerun the install.

4. **Configure Reticulum**
   - Ensure your Reticulum config is available in `~/.reticulum/config` (Termux home is `/data/data/com.termux/files/home`).
   - You can copy an existing config or bootstrap Reticulum inside Termux following the [Reticulum docs](https://reticulum.network/).

5. **Run rBrowser**
   ```bash
   python3 rBrowser.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
   ```
   - `127.0.0.1` keeps the web UI bound to the phone. Use `--host 0.0.0.0` if you want to reach it from another device on the same network.

6. **Open the interface**
   - In Android‚Äôs browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.), visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
   - Keep Termux in the foreground or use `termux-wake-lock` + Android‚Äôs battery settings to prevent the OS from suspending the session.

7. **Stopping**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in Termux to stop the server, then `termux-wake-unlock` if you enabled the wake lock.

> **Tip:** For quicker restarts, create a small shell script in Termux (e.g., `~/start-rbrowser.sh`) that activates a virtual environment, runs rBrowser, and acquires the wake lock before launching.

> **Please note:** The current UI is not fully optimized for small screen mobile devices, improvements will come soon.

### Termux Troubleshooting

- **‚ÄúPermission denied / Address already in use‚Äù when starting Reticulum**  
  Reticulum tries to start a shared instance and bind the interfaces defined in `~/.reticulum/config`. On Android, the default Unix socket path (`/var/run/reticulum.sock`) is not writable, and a previous Reticulum session may still hold the network ports. Fix it by either:
  1. Stopping any old process: `pkill -f reticulum` (run inside Termux); or
  2. Editing your Reticulum config and disabling the shared instance (`share_instance: no`) or pointing `shared_path` to a writable directory inside Termux (e.g., `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.reticulum/reticulum.sock`), and ensuring each `TCPServer`/`TCPClient` interface uses a free port.

- **Shared instance already running but unreachable**  
  If you intentionally run `rnsd` in the background, keep it active and start rBrowser in the same session without killing it. Otherwise, stop the daemon before running rBrowser so it can bring up its own embedded Reticulum node.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues:

- Input parameters sending could fail on pages with non-standard nomadnet micron link format, due to unique fields customization  (BTW >95% of pages are perfectly working!)

-----

## üêõ Bug or issues report:

- If you find bugs or any other issue, feel free to contact the developer on Reticulum at:

```
- LXMF Address: 0d051f3b6f844380c3e0c5d14e37fac8
```

or directly open a github issue here!


-----

## üí° Development Notes

- The browser creates an identity file (`nomadnet_browser_identity`) on first run
- Reticulum configuration is stored in the default location (`~/.reticulum/`)
- The application runs as a single-page application with AJAX content loading
- Fallback Micron parser is included if the original parser fails to load
- Detailed logs are printed by the python script in the terminal
- If Search Engine is enabled (ON by default), Nomadnet pages will be chached locally in /cache/nodes folder


-----

## üõ† Troubleshooting

**No nodes appearing:**
- Verify Reticulum network connectivity and configuration!
- Check that NomadNetwork nodes are active on your network
- Ensure firewall allows Reticulum traffic

**Page loading failures:**
- Confirm the target node is online and reachable
- Check network connectivity to the Reticulum network
- Verify the page path exists on the target node

**Micron rendering issues:**
- Ensure `micron-parser_original.js` is in the `script/` directory
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try toggling to Raw View to see source content

**In case of disconnections from network**
- Chech the bottom left status bar for connection info and status
- If disconnected, verify that the python script is running
- Verify your RNS config carefully before running the script
- Check critical logs in terminal, logs are shown from the Reticulum instance log into the script terminal.

**Common Errors:**

- Failed to initialize: Attempt to reinitialise Reticulum when it was already running: make sure to close other running reticulum process or instances
- Reticulum error logs in terminal: check your Reticulum settings and interfaces configuration in /youruser/.reticulum/config file. 

-----

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Traffic Usage Warning:

The included Search Engine generates network traffic when enabled, by requesting remote pages. It requests by default only the index.mu page but you can try to fetch more pages with "Cache additional pages" in the Search Engine settings. 

**IF YOU ARE USING LORA INTERFACE, DISABLE THE SEARCH ENGINE** (TO AVOID CONSUMING ALL YOUR AIRTIME AND GENERATING UNWANTED NETWORK TRAFFIC!)
